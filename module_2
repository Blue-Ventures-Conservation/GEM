Welcome to Module 2 of the GEEMMM. This module will be used to: 1.) Explore the 
spectral relationships between the classification reference areas (CRAs) classes. 2.) 
Generate the land cover classification maps using the inputs from Module 1 and the 
Random forest classifier. Module 2’s workflow is less linear than Module 1’s. In the first 
step, the user can generate a series of charts and tables that they can use to explore index 
correlations and spectral separability between land cover classes. The primary output 
from Module 2 are the single-band land cover classification images, the number can 
range from one to six classifications (see below). Associated with each classification are
quantitative accuracy metrics and matrices. 

GEEMMM Module 2 is broken down into 3 sections:

    Section 1: The user sets the inputs and parameters (including the CRAs), and reestablishes 
               the chosen indices. 

    Section 2: The spectral relationship section. The user can view the spectral space of 
               each land cover class across any of the  various bands or indices. 
               Additionally, correlation matrices can be generated for the calculated 
               indices. Take time to explore the data in this step, and affirm that the 
               desired land cover classes are truly spectrally distinct.

    Section 3: The classification section. Depending on the desired output 
               maps, chosen before the script is run, the classification(s) will be added 
               to the map viewer and the accuracy metrics will populate in the console 
               including the validation overall accuracy, validation matrix, the 
               resubstitution overall accuracy, and the resubstitution matrix. 

The classification reference areas (CRAs) will be divided to separately train and then 
validate the classifier and classification results, respectively. Randomly, 70% of the CRAs
will be used to train the classifier, and the remaining 30% are used to validate the results.
The CRAs used in the GEEMMM pilot study employed the the coordinate reference system (CRS) 
"EPSG:4326 - WGS 84". However, GEE "... is designed so that you rarely have to worry about 
map projections when doing computations." Follow the link below to learn more about GEE and 
data projections:  https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/projections

The output classification images should be exported to the user’s assets. After pressing the 
‘Run’ button at the top of the script editor, the user will be re-prompted to select the indices 
they selected in Module 1. Once the workflow has begun it can take as little as two minutes to 
work through Module 2 and view classification results, not accounting for exporting times of the 
outputs or prolonged exploration of the spectral separability. Times may vary depending on internet
speed.

The default parameters, as discussed in the GEEMMM ReadMe file, were established 
during a pilot study conducted for the country of Myanmar (Burma). Many of 
these parameters may also work for other parts of the world, but the developers 
make no claims about the transferability of default settings to other locations.
For applying the GEEMMM elsewhere, please pay careful attention to the parameters 
and set them according to the local situation and project goals/objectives.   

At the end of the workflow, the user should have started exporting:
    1.) 1 - 6 land cover maps
        a.) High tide comtemporary land cover map
        b.) Low tide comtemporary land cover map
        c.) Combination comtemporary land cover map
        d.) High tide historic land cover map
        e.) Low tide historic land cover map
        f.) Combination historic land cover map
    * - Additionally, they may have saved the output classification
        accuracy metrics or any of the graphs/tables from Section 2

Before running Module 2, please read through the comments below to determine 
important user inputs and parameters that will be used in this workflow. Continue until 
you reach the end, where you will be prompted to now ‘Run’ the script.

Bring in Imagery and Masks exported from Module 1. Name as follows:

  Chot = HOT contemporary composite (HOT_Img_contemporary); highest observed tide
  Clot = LOT contemporary composite (LOT_Img_contemporary); lowest observed tide

  Hhot = HOT historic composite (HOT_Img_historic); highest observed tide
  Hlot = LOT historic composite (LOT_Img_historic); lowest observed tide

  final_mask = Finalized mask (final_mask)
  
  ROI =  Finalized ROI (ROI), region of interest 

This can be done by selecting the assets from the 'Asset' tab and clicking the 
arrow to import the asset to this script. Once imported, the name can be changed
by clicking the automatic 'image' name (see top of the script) and renaming.

/////////    Section 1: User Inputs  //////////
///////////////////////////////////////////////

1.A) Classification Reference areas 
     The most significant input for the classification are the classification
     reference areas (CRAs). The CRAs set must be created by the user. 
     This can be done within the GEE environment or externally and uploaded as a 
     GEE user asset. To execute the classification, the user will be asked below 
     about several important parameters associated with the classification
     process, but at this time the user must simply identify the classification 
     reference areas that will be used to determine the output land cover classes.
     This is a vector dataset. It can be a multi-point or multi-polygon geometry. 
     It is also important that the user declares which field the unique class 
     labels (numeric & character) are recorded in. There should be a unique  
     integer and character name associated with each CRA class.
     
     Enter:
          var class_ref = **PATH**; (Path to the CRAs)
*/

var class_ref_cont = "users/yanchojo/reference_data/cont_CRD_0914";
var class_ref_hist = "users/yanchojo/reference_data/hist_CRD_0914";
// Landcover labels for the classifier
var class_label_numeric = 'ID';
var class_label_character = 'Classname';



/*
1.B) Classification Reference Area (CRA) Type
     Record type of CRA. It is important for the GEEMMM that the user distinguishes 
     their CRAs as either spatio-temporally invariant across the time-period (historic
     and contemporary imagery) or derived from just contemporary sources. 
     
     1.) Spatio-temporally invariant: The CRAs have not changed between the historic
                                      years of interest and the contemporary years of 
                                      interest.t - a single set of CRAs is used for both
                                      classifications.
     2.) Not spatio-temporally invariant: The CRAs have changed between the historic years 
                                          of interest and the contemporary years of interest 
                                          - a separate set of CRAs is used for each 
                                          classification (i.e., historic and contemporary). 
                            
     These are important distinctions to make. If the CRAs are not spatio-temporally 
     invariant, the classifier will be retrained for both the historic and contemporary 
     image sets.  If the CRAs are spatio-temporally invariant, the same set will be used 
     for historic and contemporary classifications.  
     
     Enter:
          var class_ref_type = true; (the CRAs are spatio-temporally invariant)
          var class_ref_type = false; (the CRAs are NOT Spatio-temporally invariant)
*/

var class_ref_type = false;

/*
1.B.i) Classification Reference Area (CRA) Type: Missing Historic CRA
  If the data is not spatio-temporally invariant, but historic CRAs are not available, the
  user has the option to use contemporary landsat spectral values for trained contemporary
  CRAs subset to classify the historic data. For this feature to work 'class_ref_type' needs 
  to be set to 'true' to ensure that the historic classifications are using the contemporary 
  CRAs data and the 'use_cont_spec' (below) must be set to 'true'. 
  
  Alternatively, historic outputs do not need be generated in Module 2. Simply make all of the
  historic classification outputs in 1.D to 'false'. However, if this is the case the dynamics
  analysis in Module 3 will not work properly (since there will only be one land cover map).
  
          **NOTE: Default if 'false'. Do not switch to 'true' unless certain.**
  
       Enter:
          var use_cont_spec = true; (uses the contemporary trained classifier to 
                                      classify the historic imagery)
          var use_cont_spec = false; (uses the CRAs data as designated in 1.A)

*/

var use_cont_spec = false; 

/*
1.C) Classifier
     GEE offers a variety of classifiers. These come in both supervised and 
     unsupervised classifier choices. At this time however, the GEEMMM is built to
     run the Random Forest Classifier, a supervised decision tree classifier.
     Future versions will offer more classification options. The Random Forest 
     classifier is one of the most well-researched classifiers, and has routinely
     been shown to produce accurate results. 

     Enter:
          var classifier = 'RF'; (To use the Random Forest Classifier)
*/

var classifier = 'RF';
var trees = 200;

/*

1.D) Output Structure
     The outputs from the GEEMMM can be generated as either a combined
     (where the high- and low-tide data are combined into a single collection) 
     or separate (individual high- and low-tide) classifications. Outputs below can 
     be turned on and off by adding a 'true'/'false' to the corresponding 
     variable input. The historic and contemporary data is separable into LOT
     and HOT components. (HOT: Highest Observable Tide; LOT: Lowest Observable
     Tide.)
     
     Enter:
          var XXX_out = true; (Classify and export this composite)
          var XXX_out = false; (No action)
*/
var HOT_cont_out = false;        // High tide comtemporary Imagery
var LOT_cont_out = false;        // Low tide comtemporary Imagery
var combo_cont_out = true;     // Combination comtemporary Imagery
var HOT_hist_out = false;        // High tide historic Imagery
var LOT_hist_out = false;        // Low tide historic Imagery
var combo_hist_out = true;     // Combination historic Imagery

      What follows is the bulk of the script for module 2 - below this line 
      the user does not need to further change anything. Comments are provided
      for each section/step below so the user can understand how the script 
      actually works. All further user action occurs in the ‘Console'.
      
      NOTE:
      -Once the workflow begins, you will have to re-select the indices from
       GEEMMM Module 1. 
      -Take as much time as you need to explore the spectral relationships of 
       the CRAs and input composite bands. Some items take a while to load, 
       so do not initate more than one task at a time.
      -The spectral correlation matrices take a long time to generate and 
       may freeze the browser. The more indices being correlated the longer
       this task will take. If an memory limit error occurs, click the button
       again to re-start the task. It should load the second time.
      -The classification can be started at anytime.
      -Do not change the name of the exports unless you are an advanced GIS user
